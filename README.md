# Project Description
We are asked to create a simeple computer that can support a 24-bit input with the first 8-bits dedicated to an instruction and the remaining 16 bits for two operands with 8 bits each. We will have 8 general purpose register(named r1,r2,...,r8), 2 8-bit Memory Address Register, 1 8-bit Program Counter, 1 8-bit Instruction Counter and 1 8-bit Flag functioning as zero flag and sign flag(the first most significant bits for the zero flag and the last 4 bits for the sign flag). The following instructions must be included. Details not included such as the format of the instruction, number of operands, and assigned binary value are dependent on the creator.
